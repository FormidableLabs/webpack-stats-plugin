This plugin will ingest the webpack [stats](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/#stats) object, process / transform the object and write out to a file for further consumption.

The most common use case is building a hashed bundle and wanting to programmatically refer to the correct bundle path in your Node.js server.

## Installation

The plugin is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-stats-plugin):

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev webpack-stats-plugin
$ yarn add --dev webpack-stats-plugin
```

## Examples

We have example webpack configurations for all versions of webpack. See., e.g. [`test/scenarios/webpack5/webpack.config.js`](test/scenarios/webpack5/webpack.config.js).

### CLI

If you are using `webpack-cli`, you can enable with:

```sh
$ webpack-cli --plugin webpack-stats-plugin/lib/stats-writer-plugin
```

### Basic

A basic `webpack.config.js`-based integration:

```js
const { StatsWriterPlugin } = require("webpack-stats-plugin")

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // Everything else **first**.

    // Write out stats file to build directory.
    new StatsWriterPlugin({
      filename: "stats.json" // Default
    })
  ]
}
```

### Custom `stats` Configuration

This option is passed to the webpack compiler's [`getStats().toJson()`](https://webpack.js.org/api/node/#statstojsonoptions) method.

```js
const { StatsWriterPlugin } = require("webpack-stats-plugin")

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new StatsWriterPlugin({
      stats: {
        all: false,
        assets: true
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

### Custom Transform Function

The transform function has a signature of:

```js
/**
 * Transform skeleton.
 *
 * @param {Object} data           Stats object
 * @param {Object} opts           Options
 * @param {Object} opts.compiler  Current compiler instance
 * @returns {String}              String to emit to file
 */
function (data, opts) {}
```

which you can use like:

```js
const { StatsWriterPlugin } = require("webpack-stats-plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new StatsWriterPlugin({
      transform(data, opts) {
        return JSON.stringify({
          main: data.assetsByChunkName.main[0],
          css: data.assetsByChunkName.main[1]
        }, null, 2);
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

### Promise transform

You can use an asynchronous promise to transform as well:

```js
const { StatsWriterPlugin } = require("webpack-stats-plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new StatsWriterPlugin({
      filename: "stats-transform-promise.json",
      transform(data) {
        return Promise.resolve().then(() => JSON.stringify({
          main: data.assetsByChunkName.main
        }, null, INDENT));
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

## Plugins

* [`StatsWriterPlugin(opts)`](#statswriterplugin-opts-)

### `StatsWriterPlugin(opts)`
* **opts** (`Object`) options
* **opts.filename** (`String|Function`) output file name (Default: `"stats.json"`)
* **opts.fields** (`Array`) fields of stats obj to keep (Default: `["assetsByChunkName"]`)
* **opts.stats** (`Object|String`) stats config object or string preset (Default: `{}`)
* **opts.transform** (`Function|Promise`) transform stats obj (Default: `JSON.stringify()`)
* **opts.emit** (`Boolean`) add stats file to webpack output? (Default: `true`)

Stats writer module.

Stats can be a string or array (we'll have an array due to source maps):

```js
"assetsByChunkName": {
  "main": [
    "cd6371d4131fbfbefaa7.bundle.js",
    "../js-map/cd6371d4131fbfbefaa7.bundle.js.map"
  ]
},
```

**`fields`, `stats`**

The stats object is **big**. It includes the entire source included in a bundle. Thus, we default `opts.fields` to `["assetsByChunkName"]` to only include those. However, if you want the _whole thing_ (maybe doing an `opts.transform` function), then you can set `fields: null` in options to get **all** of the stats object.

You may also pass a custom stats config object (or string preset) via `opts.stats` in order to select exactly what you want added to the data passed to the transform. When `opts.stats` is passed, `opts.fields` will default to `null`.

See:
- https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/#stats
- https://webpack.js.org/api/node/#stats-object

**`filename`**

The `opts.filename` option can be a file name or path relative to `output.path` in webpack configuration. It should not be absolute. It may also be a function, in which case it will be passed the current compiler instance and expected to return a filename to use.

**`transform`**

By default, the retrieved stats object is `JSON.stringify`'ed but by supplying an alternate transform you can target _any_ output format. See [`test/scenarios/webpack5/webpack.config.js`](test/scenarios/webpack5/webpack.config.js) for various examples including Markdown output.

- **Warning**: The output of `transform` should be a `String`, not an object. On Node `v4.x` if you return a real object in `transform`, then webpack will break with a `TypeError` (See [#8](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-stats-plugin/issues/8)). Just adding a simple `JSON.stringify()` around your object is usually what you need to solve any problems.

**Internal notes**

In modern webpack, the plugin uses the [`processAssets`](https://webpack.js.org/api/compilation-hooks/#processassets) compilation hook if available when adding the stats object file to the overall compilation to write out along with all the other webpack-built assets. This is the [last possible place](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/f2f998b58362d5edc9945a48f8245a3347ad007c/lib/Compilation.js#L2000-L2007) to hook in before the compilation is frozen in future webpack releases.

In earlier webpack, the plugin uses the much later [`emit`](https://webpack.js.org/api/compiler-hooks/#emit) compiler hook. There are technically some assets/stats data that could be added after `processAssets` and before `emit`, but for most practical uses of this plugin users shouldn't see any differences in the usable data produced by different versions of webpack.

## Contributions

Contributions welcome!

We test against all versions of webpack. For a full explanation of our functional tests, see [test/README.md](test/README.md)

To get started, first install:

```sh
$ yarn
```

Our tests first do various webpack builds and then run mocha asserts on the real outputted stats files. Inefficient, but for our small sample size efficient enough.

```sh
# Lint and tests
$ yarn run lint
$ yarn run test

# All together
$ yarn run check
```

## Maintenance Status

**Active:** Formidable is actively working on this project, and we expect to continue for work for the foreseeable future. Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are welcome.
